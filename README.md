# Hello !! I'm David 🐸🐟

I'm a big fan of free software (FOSS), low level programmation and cool stuff. I'm an enthusiastic guy. I want to help and pass on responsible knowledge. I have many interests in private life and decentralization. I dream of working on useful projects and traveling around the world.

I also have a lot of useless hobbies.
My current one is typing really fast, language learning and probably fish.

I'm open for contributing !
